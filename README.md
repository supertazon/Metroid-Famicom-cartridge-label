For personal and educational use only.

The PDF can be printed directly, it is set at the correct size to fit a Famicom cartridge shell. If you have it printed by a shop, make sure they cut following the green border.

The SVG file was built using Inkscape and can be modified as you see fit.

SVG layers (from top to bottom):
| Layer  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **Borders**  | is the shape of a Famicom cartridge label, to be used as a guide and not to be printed  |
| **Logo**  | Japanese Metroid logo, adapted from <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/imleerobson/art/Metroid-Vector-Logo-Famicom-1986-703812394">imLeeRobson's DeviantArt</a>  |
| **Text**  | contains all the text elements: vector Nintendo logo taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nintendo_red_logo.svg), same for the vector [Family Computer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Family_Computer_logo.svg), the rest is text I wrote using free fonts available that were close enough to the original|
| **Color rectangle**  | red rectangle that is a background to HVC-ME |
| **White bg**  | a white mask was needed to retain the same layout as the original The Legend of Zelda Famicom cartridge  |
| **Samus**  | probably the most difficult part of the label. I re-used the original work art from the Famicom Disk System disk, taken from [Wikitroid](https://metroid.fandom.com/wiki/Metroid_(game)?file=Metroid_FDS_boxart.jpg) and basically used different online image editors to remove the background, enhance Samus, enhance the background and stitch them back together|

I made a custom cartridge by transplanting the ROM chip from a [NTSC cartridge](https://nescartdb.com/profile/view/224/metroid), to a Famicom game cartridge PCB using the proper MMC1A mapper [Tanigawa Kouji no Shougi Shinan II](https://nescartdb.com/profile/view/1462/tanigawa-kouji-no-shougi-shinan-ii) and using the shell of [Tetris Flash
](https://nescartdb.com/profile/view/2157/tetris-flash) which has the right red tone and holds a PCB having the same dimensions as Tanigawa's.
